            <p className="text-base text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-4">Each centre is deployed using the same structural layout, machine configuration, and operating logic. This ensures consistency in how centers are set up, used, and managed across locations.</p>

            <p className="text-base text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-4">By standardizing the environment, we reduce variability, control costs, and enable repeatable outcomes without redesigning the model for each deployment.</p>

            <p className="text-base text-gray-700 leading-relaxed">Flexibility exists within the framework, not outside it. Local conditions are accommodated without altering the core structure or operating approach.</p>
